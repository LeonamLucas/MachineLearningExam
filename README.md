# Final Exam for my Machine Learning class

The objective was to show what I learned during my introdutory class on Machine Learning. A lot (if not most) of the code is not an effective way to deal with data,
because I was coding this as I was having the classes, so things i learned later in the course could've helped in a problem I didn't know how to fix then.
It is not very organized too, I had very little time to do this so I had to prioritize what my teacher was asking and deliver results that made sense.
